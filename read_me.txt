Overview of the function of the code:

Code allows the user to choose the city, month and the week day for the data to be analysed. For week day and month there is a possibility to choose 'all' so that data from all months or/and week days is used. 

When these are set the user can choose to display the data in chunks of 5 or to run some statistics on the filtered data. 

The statistics that can be run are the functions predefined in the code: 'time_stats', 'station_stats', 'trip_duration_stats' and 'user_stats'. After the funciton is run user gets to redo the input or choose to end. If the user decides to end a choice is presented to rerun the whole script or to terminate the program.
